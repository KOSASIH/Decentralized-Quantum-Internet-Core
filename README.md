# Decentralized-Quantum-Internet-Core
The Decentralized-Quantum-Internet-Core repository serves as the foundational framework for building a next-generation quantum communication network. This project leverages quantum entanglement and quantum key distribution (QKD) to enable ultra-secure, decentralized data transmission. Designed for interoperability with existing networks, the core components facilitate the development of secure applications across various sectors, including finance, healthcare, and national security. Join us in revolutionizing the future of secure communication!
