# Decentralized-Quantum-Internet-Core
The Decentralized-Quantum-Internet-Core repository serves as the foundational framework for building a next-generation quantum communication network. This project leverages quantum entanglement and quantum key distribution (QKD) to enable ultra-secure, decentralized data transmission.
