# Security Best Practices

## Overview
This document outlines best practices for securing your quantum communication applications.

## Key Practices
1. **Use Strong Encryption**: Always use strong encryption methods for classical data transmission.
2. **Regularly Update Dependencies**: Keep your libraries and dependencies up to date to mitigate vulnerabilities.
3. **Implement Access Controls**: Use role-based access controls to restrict access to sensitive operations.

## Monitoring and Auditing
- Regularly monitor network traffic for unusual patterns.
- Implement logging to track access and changes to the system.

## Conclusion
Following these best practices will help ensure the security and integrity of your quantum communication system.
