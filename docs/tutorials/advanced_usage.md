# Advanced Usage

## Introduction
This document covers advanced features and configurations of the Decentralized Quantum Internet Core.

## Customizing Node Configuration
You can customize yournode settings by modifying the `config.py` file located in the `src/utils/` directory. Key parameters include:

- **Node ID**: Unique identifier for your node.
- **Network Protocol**: Choose between different communication protocols.
- **Entanglement Parameters**: Adjust settings for entanglement generation.

## Implementing Custom Protocols
To implement a custom protocol, extend the `protocol.py` file in the `src/network/` directory. Follow these steps:

1. Define your protocol class.
2. Implement the required methods for message handling.
3. Register your protocol in the main networking module.

## Performance Tuning
For optimal performance, consider the following:

- **Adjusting Buffer Sizes**: Modify buffer sizes in the `network_security.py` file to handle larger data packets.
- **Load Balancing**: Implement load balancing strategies in the `routing.py` file to distribute traffic evenly across nodes.

## Conclusion
By leveraging these advanced features, you can enhance the functionality and performance of your quantum communication applications.
